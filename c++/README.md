# C++ Exam: Binary Tree

### Jesus Espinoza and Federico Barone

--------------------------------



For this exercise we were asked to implement a binary tree class.

```Main.cpp``` contains the implementation of the class as well as a few simple tests to check the different methods of the class and a benchmark of its performance (how the find method performs).

Full ```doxygen``` documentation of the code is available in the documentation folder. Check ```index.html``` file for a supreme experience.

To run either the test or the benchmark execute the following commands:





Figure 1 shows the results of the benchark. We compared the perfomance of the following data structures:

*  A linked list (actually it is our binary tree with nodes inserted in ascending order)
* A 
*
