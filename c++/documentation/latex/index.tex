For this exercise we were asked to implement a binary tree class.

{\ttfamily Main.\+cpp} contains the implementation of the class as well as a few simple tests to check the different methods of the class and a benchmark of its performance (how the find method performs).

Full {\ttfamily doxygen} documentation of the code is available in the documentation folder. Check {\ttfamily index.\+html} file for a supreme experience.

To run either the test or the benchmark execute the following commands\+:

Figure 1 shows the results of the benchark. We compared the perfomance of the following data structures\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A linked list (actually it is our binary tree with nodes inserted in ascending order)
\item A
\item 
\end{DoxyItemize}
