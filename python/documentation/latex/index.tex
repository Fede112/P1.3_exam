For this exercise we were asked to implement a class that handles a list of postcards organized in different files.

The class should include specific member functions which its implementation can be explained with the following workflow example\+:

Initially we have three files\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item File 1 contains a list of postcards
\item File 2 contains a different list of postcards
\item File 3 is empty.
\end{DoxyItemize}

We create an instance of {\ttfamily postcard\+List} which is initially empty. The function {\ttfamily read\+File(\+F1)} populates the object with the information of F1. Note that self.\+\_\+file = F1. {\ttfamily update\+Lists(\+F2)} updates the information stored in the object with the one contained in F2 and calls the {\ttfamily update\+File()} function to dump the new information in File 1 (the file associated with the object). Lastly, {\ttfamily write\+File(\+F3)} is used to dump the information stored in the object to a new file. The object is still associated with F1. There are additional member functions that handle specific queries to the postcard\+List. More documentation is available in the documentation folder. We did it with {\ttfamily Doxygen} just to try it out.

There were a lot different implementations, we choose this as an example, trying to force consistency between the instance of the class and the file associated to it.
